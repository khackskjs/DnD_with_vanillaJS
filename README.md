# Implementation of Drag and Drop with vanilla JS

I just tested how drag and drop works

This project doesn't involve refactoring or performance optimization, but just focused on implementation.

If `div.area` has some child element who is block in css stacking context, 
you need to modify coordinate that `item` moved after.
I think it's possible for you to solve with adding one more layer area.
